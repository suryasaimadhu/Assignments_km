Write the below programs by writing a separate function and calling it in main function:

1) Write a function to calculate simple interest. Call it in main function with appropriate inputs and print the total amount the user will get after the tenure (principle + interest)

2) Write a function that takes two numbers, a and n as input arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n.

3) Write a function that takes two numbers a and b as input arguments and returns their product as return value , without using * operator.

4) Write a function that takes two numbers a and b, and returns the quotient after dividing a with b.

5)  Write a function that takes two numbers a and b, and returns the remainder after dividing a with b.


6) Write a function that takes an integer number as input and prints its multiplication table.return type is  void.

//when different outputs need to be returned for different conditions,you can store the value in a variable for different conditions, and return the variable at the end. for example if you have to return 1 or 0 for prime / not prime conditions, you can store the value in a variable.

// or you can write different return statements in different conditions. only one of them will execute. we will discuss more on this tomorrow.

7) write a function that can take an integer as input and return 1 if the number is prime number,  return 0 if it is not prime and print appropriate output message in main according to output.
return type is integer. function name IsPrime - returns int (0 or 1)


8) Write a function to determine if a character is alphanumeric or not and print the appropriate output in main function. (return 1 if it is alphanumeric, 0 if it is not alpha numeric).
Hint: int fun_alpha_num(char c).

9) Write a calculator program with 5 functions below to do the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division for quotient and division for remainder.
1) int add (int a, int b) // to be called when user chooses +
2) int sub (int a,int b) // to be called when user chooses -
3) int mul(int a, int b) // to be called when user chooses *
4) int quotient(int a, int b) // to be called when user chooses /
5) int remainder(int a,int b) // to be called when user choose%

10) Write a function to accept a year as input and return 1 if the year is a leap year, otherwise 0.

11) Write a function to accept a month and year as input, and return the number of days in that month as output. print the number of days in main.

12) Write a function ,that can take two integers, swap their values and print their new values. return type should be void. function should print the values.

13) Write a function that takes 2 dates as inputs, and returns 1 if the first date is old, 2 if the second date is old.

14) Write a  function that takes a date as input, and returns 1 if the date is valid, 0 if the date is invalid.
###################################################
1) 
Write a program with a function that takes two integer arguments, and prints all prime numbers between those numbers using the prime number function written previously. 

PrintAllPrimes - return type is void. Should use IsPrime() from yesterdays assignments that returns int.

2)Write a function that takes two numbers, a and n as input arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n without using * operator. Write all three functions in three different source code files.

3) Write a factorial function that takes a number as input and returns its factorial as output.

4) Write a factorial function that calculates factorial without using * operator.

5) Write a program to calculate the sum of the below series upto n terms:

1 - 1/2! + 1 / 3! - 1/4! + 1/5! - 1/6! ..... 1/n!

6) Write the calculator program with the functions distributed in 3 different files as shown below, 
compile and execute it. the main function should take inputs from user in a loop, as long as user wants to execute the calculator functionality.

main function in main.c 

add and subtract functions in add.c 

mul, div ,remainder functions in mul.c
